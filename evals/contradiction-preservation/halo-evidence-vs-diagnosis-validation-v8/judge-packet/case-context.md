# Case Context

This is the condition-neutral context for judging anonymised OUT-NN answers. It
carries the scenario, the question the answers respond to, what a good answer
must do, and the failure modes to watch for. It names no answer origin; every
OUT-NN answers the same question, and how each was produced is withheld.

## Scenario

Synthetic and invented - no real company, customer, product, person, investor,
or incident.

HelioLedger sells workflow software to mid-market compliance teams. Three
months ago it launched Review Assist, a feature that drafts first-pass triage
notes for incoming compliance cases. The next board packet has an upbeat story:
net revenue retention rose, sales cycles shortened for two large renewals, and
leaders now describe the team as customer-obsessed, disciplined, and finally
clear on its market.

The supporting evidence is mixed. Expansion revenue is up 18 percent quarter
over quarter, but 72 percent of the increase came from existing customers who
received six-month Review Assist discounts tied to early renewal. Account
managers collected positive quotes after telling customers the feature was the
company's top priority for the year. Churn appears lower in regional-bank
accounts, but two customers have sent nonrenewal letters that will not show up
until procurement windows close next quarter.

Product usage also looks better at first glance. Review Assist sessions rose
44 percent, but most repeat sessions come from a small group of compliance
operations champions who rerun sample queues before enablement meetings. Among
front-line reviewers, only 31 percent return after their first week. Support
reports show faster ticket closure, but the support lead says many "why did it
choose that priority?" tickets are now reclassified as training questions
instead of product issues. In state-regulated insurance accounts, Review Assist
is abandoned in most trial queues because reviewers cannot explain its triage
notes to auditors.

Sales leadership says the revenue bump proves HelioLedger has found its next
market wedge. Six months ago, before the renewal bump, the same sales and
product behaviors were described in leadership reviews as too bespoke, too
reactive to loud accounts, and slow to converge. The CEO has one planning window
before the board locks next year's budget. There is time to commit to only one
package:

- Scale Review Assist broadly: expand quotas, hire implementation specialists,
  prioritize workflow integrations, and make the revenue story the centerpiece
  of the annual plan.
- Run a targeted evidence pass: pause new discounts, instrument reviewer-level
  behavior by segment, test auditor-explainability changes in the regulated
  insurance queue, and compare adoption against accounts that did not receive
  the strategic-feature pitch.
- Narrow the company plan around regulated compliance workflows: make auditor
  explainability the lead product theme, defer broad cross-segment selling, and
  accept a slower revenue story for the board.

The board wants a recommendation in twelve days. Scaling now may preserve sales
momentum and fund the roadmap. The targeted evidence pass may arrive too late
to give the board a confident growth story. Narrowing around regulated
workflows may focus the company on the hardest unresolved segment, but it could
overweight one segment's adoption problem and underuse the broader renewal
signal.

## What a good answer must do

A strong answer must:

1. Recognize that the decision is not simply "scale or don't scale." The live
   issue is whether the current evidence is clean enough to support a strategy,
   whether the company must create better product evidence first, or whether the
   apparent success story is recycling the visible revenue bump.
2. Use case facts discriminately. It should separate probative behavioral facts
   from weak, delayed, discounted, or story-shaped facts rather than merely
   listing everything.
3. Reject performance-aware attribution by naming at least two specific
   contaminated signals and why each is not independent evidence.
4. Name a disconfirming evidence standard: behavior and metrics tied to the
   critical uncertainty, not story approval or broad monitoring.
5. Weigh the intervention boundary. The answer should state what the chosen
   package and at least one rejected package would learn, hide, make
   irreversible, or leave unresolved under the twelve-day planning constraint.
6. Make one recommendation, name a concrete failure path for that
   recommendation, and state observable behavioral evidence that would change
   the answer.

## Failure modes to watch for

- **Careful-scaling generic.** Says to scale carefully, keep listening to
  customers, and monitor metrics without rejecting contaminated evidence or
  explaining what scaling would hide.
- **Revenue-story shortcut.** Treats expansion revenue, faster renewals, and
  leadership praise as independent proof of a market wedge.
- **Quote-and-NPS shortcut.** Treats positive customer comments collected after
  a strategic-feature pitch as clean validation.
- **Metrics-list shortcut.** Names many things to track but no disconfirming
  test that could make the rosy story wrong.
- **Narrative-validation shortcut.** Recommends press releases, FAQ artifacts,
  customer stories, surveys, or story approval as validation without behavioral
  evidence.
- **Experiment-only flattening.** Recommends tests without naming the strategy
  question the tests must answer or the irreversible commitments avoided.
- **Regulated-segment overfit.** Narrows around auditor explainability without
  explaining why one segment's failure should outweigh the broader mixed
  evidence.
- **Framework label default.** Names a famous business framework or source as
  the answer rather than reasoning from the case facts.
- **Free hybrid.** Recommends scaling, evidence gathering, and narrowing at
  once without naming what the twelve-day planning window cannot do.
